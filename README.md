Network Ninja CTF 2022
==============================

Here are the challenges from the Network Ninja 2022 Capture the Flag Contest. Additional challenges will be added a day after challenges are closed.  You will need docker to run these challenges.

No vulnerabilities are implied in sudo, nor in the unix utilies to which privilege has been granted.  Needless to say the rules shouldn't be used for anything other than this exercise.

### Requirements
docker

### Building
```bash
./bin/build.sh
```

### Running challenges
```bash
./bin/challenge.sh [1..3]
```
